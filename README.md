## INTRODUCTION
This case study demonstrates how I leveraged Microsoft Excel and Power BI to automate PureSip's Beverages sales data integration through local folder connectivity. By connecting Power BI directly to a centralized folder containing retailer sales spreadsheets, the company eliminated manual data consolidation, improved reporting accuracy, and streamlined its sales analysis process.

The solution enabled automatic data refresh whenever new sales files were added to the folder, ensuring stakeholders always had access to the latest sales information. Interactive dashboards were developed to provide visibility into sales performance, retailer contributions, regional trends, product demand, and revenue generation.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
PureSip Beverages distributes popular beverage brands such as Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite to major retailers including Costco, Walmart, Target, and Walgreens. Each regional manager maintained separate sales spreadsheets, creating several operational challenges:

- Data Consolidation

Combining multiple retailer spreadsheets into a unified sales report required significant manual effort, making the process time-consuming and prone to errors.

- Data Accuracy

Variations in spreadsheet structures, naming conventions, and data-entry practices across regions often resulted in inconsistencies and reporting inaccuracies.

- Limited Analysis

Traditional spreadsheet reporting provided limited capabilities for advanced analytics, making it difficult to identify sales trends, retailer performance, regional opportunities, and product demand patterns.


## AIM OF THE PROJECT
- Automate the integration of sales data from multiple retailer spreadsheets using Power BI Folder Connections.
- Improve data accuracy and consistency by eliminating manual consolidation processes.
- Analyze sales performance across retailers, regions, and beverage brands.
- Develop interactive dashboards to monitor key business metrics and support strategic decision-making.
- Create a scalable reporting solution capable of accommodating future business growth.

  
## METHODOLOGY 
Explored retailer sales datasets to understand key fields, business relationships, and reporting requirements.

**STEP 1: ETL PROCESS**

**STEP 2: DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT**

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance and market penetration for Pure Sip’s beverage products. Focusing on data from 2022 to 2023, it integrates interactive parameters, including a "Beverage Brand" and a "Contact" filter, that allow users to drill down and analyze specific segments. This enables a focused analysis of regional sales via the interactive map, retailer performance across major outlets like Walmart and Costco, and top-performing brands such as Dasani Water, highlighting overall sales trends and volume.

## BUSINESS IMPACT

The implementation of Power BI Folder Connections transformed PureSip Beverages' sales reporting process by automating data collection and integration from multiple retailer spreadsheets. Instead of manually consolidating quarterly sales files, Power BI automatically combines and refreshes data whenever new files are added to the designated folder.

### Key Benefits Achieved

#### Automated Data Integration

The folder connection eliminated the need for manual data consolidation by automatically combining sales data from multiple retailers into a single reporting model.

#### Improved Data Accuracy

Standardized data processing reduced errors associated with manual data entry, spreadsheet manipulation, and inconsistent reporting formats.

#### Faster Reporting

Stakeholders gained access to near real-time sales insights, allowing them to monitor performance and respond more quickly to changing market conditions.

#### Enhanced Decision-Making

Interactive dashboards provided visibility into retailer performance, product demand, regional sales trends, and KPI achievement, enabling more informed business decisions.

#### Scalability

The solution can easily accommodate additional retailers, regions, or sales files without requiring changes to the reporting process, supporting future business growth.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Strengthen Relationships with Top Retailers

Since Walmart and Costco contribute the largest share of sales revenue, PureSip should continue strengthening partnerships with these retailers through promotional campaigns, exclusive offers, and inventory support.

### Improve Performance of Lower-Contributing Retailers

Target and Walgreens generate comparatively lower sales volumes. Management should investigate opportunities to increase sales through localized marketing initiatives and product placement strategies.

### Focus on High-Performing Beverage Brands

Dasani Water, Coca-Cola, and Diet Coke consistently generate strong sales performance. Maintaining adequate inventory levels and promotional support for these brands will help sustain revenue growth.

### Increase Promotion for Underperforming Products

Fanta records the lowest sales among the featured brands. Targeted marketing campaigns, discounts, and retailer promotions could help improve its market performance.

### Leverage Seasonal Demand Patterns

Sales peak during the middle and latter part of the year, particularly between June and August. Forecasting and inventory planning should align with these seasonal trends to prevent stock shortages and maximize revenue opportunities.

### Expand Regional Analysis

Further investigation into top-performing and underperforming regions can help identify growth opportunities and optimize distribution strategies.

## CONCLUSION

This project demonstrates how Power BI Folder Connections can effectively automate sales data integration and reporting processes. By connecting multiple retailer spreadsheets through a centralized folder, PureSip Beverages eliminated manual data consolidation, improved data accuracy, and significantly reduced reporting workload.

The resulting dashboard provides valuable insights into sales trends, retailer performance, regional distribution, and beverage brand performance. Key findings revealed strong contributions from Walmart and Costco, increasing sales momentum throughout the year, and high demand for products such as Dasani Water and Coca-Cola.

Overall, the solution showcases how Power BI can transform fragmented spreadsheet-based reporting into a scalable, automated, and data-driven business intelligence system that supports faster and more effective decision-making.
